                       I joined Georgia Tech's off-road team partway through my first semester of college after being introduced to it by a friend. 
                        I quickly found a home amongst the electrical and computer engineering oriented Data Acquisition team (DAQ), and took over as team lead at the 
                        beginning of my sophomore year. I absolutely love the explorative freedom that DAQ offers its members, and have leveraged this awesome attribute to 
                        recruit an almost entirely new team after almost all of the older members aged out.

                       During my freshman year I worked on improving our radio range through the installation of a larger antenna, helped with the addition of 
                        Hall-effect sensors on the front wheels, researched the use of a mesh network to improve the range of our data transmission set up, built a new 
                        base-station, and laid the groundwork for a complete revamp of the data collection system. These innovations led to my appointment as team lead in 
                        addition to having a real impact on the efficacy of the old DAQ setup.

                      Under my leadership DAQ has increased the polling rate of our sensors by over 3000x, revamped our documentation, 
                      and designed a new testing setup for sled pulls. I’ve directed my members to research and build a discrete wiring harness to improve data resolution 
                        and simplify the addition of sensors, reached out to previous DAQ leads to help with a PCB redesign for the Aux Daq itself (the piece of hardware 
                        that handles on-car data collection), and brought an industrial engineering friend of mine on board to help streamline many of the administrative 
                        tasks. These improvements have vastly increased the efficiency and effectiveness of our data collection solutions, aiding Off Road’s mechanical and 
                        design teams in their never-ending quest for speed.
