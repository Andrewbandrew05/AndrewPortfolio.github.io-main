                       I joined Georgia Tech's off-road team partway through my first semester of college, and took over as team lead at the 
                        beginning of my sophomore year. I've spent my time at DAQ revamping the entirety of our data collection processes and organizational structure,
                        vastly improving sensor perfomance and accuracy whilst simultaneously preserving operational information for future generations.

                       During my freshman year I worked on improving our radio range through the installation of a larger antenna, helped with the addition of 
                        hall-effect sensors on the front wheels, researched the use of a mesh network to improve the range of our data transmission set up, built a new 
                        base-station, and began exploring the viability of a complete revamp of the data collection system.

                      Under my leadership DAQ has completely redone everything that previous teams had made. We are currently in the final stages of developing our new Hive Mind data collection
                        system, revamping our data translation algorithms to reduce processing times, implementing a wide selection of new sensors, building a website for live data
                        visualization on race days, exploring the use of a neural network for trend and/or anomaly detection in our data, and designing a system to sense the fuel level
                        with ultrasonic sound waves and fast fourier transforms. None of this would've been possible without the help of my team, more than half of which have joined during
                        my time as lead.

                      DAQ has shifted to a new github repo during my team as lead which can be found <a href="https://github.com/Georgia-Tech-Off-Road/GTOR-DAQ">here</a>. Each
                        main project has it's own folder with any relevant documentation stored inside it. One notable example of this is the data visualization tool. Originally
                        built by me, this tool allows anyone on the team to download and process data files from test days and features the ability to update to the latest version
                        posted to github with the push of a button. Each screen features a button that opens documenation on how to use the tool, and an overarching .docx file provides
                        a deeper dive into the inner workings of the software. This documentation has allowed our Data Analysis and Software leads to take over development, freeing me up
                        to focus on the Hive Mind project.
