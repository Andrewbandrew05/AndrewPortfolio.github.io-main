                       I joined Georgia Tech's off-road team partway through my first semester of college, and took over as team lead at the 
                        beginning of my sophomore year. I've spent my time at DAQ revamping the entirety of our data collection processes and organizational structure,
                        vastly improving sensor perfomance and accuracy whilst simultaneously preserving operational information for future generations.

                       During my freshman year I worked on improving our radio range through the installation of a larger antenna, helped with the addition of 
                        hall-effect sensors on the front wheels, researched the use of a mesh network to improve the range of our data transmission set up, built a new 
                        base-station, and began exploring the viability of a complete revamp of the data collection system.

                      Under my leadership DAQ has completely redone everything that previous teams had made. We are currently in the final stages of developing our new Hive Mind data collection
                        system, revamping our data translation algorithms to reduce processing times, implementing a wide selection of new sensors, building a website for live data
                        visualization on race days, exploring the use of a neural network for trend and/or anomaly detection in our data, and designing a system to sense the fuel level
                        with ultrasonic sound waves and fast fourier transforms. None of this would've been possible without the help of my team, more than half of which have joined during
                        my time as lead.

                        DAQs team has grown substantially since the beginning of my tenure as lead, currently including three CS majors, two EE majors, one ISYE major, and myself.
                        This increas in man-power has rapidly increased our rate of development, allowing us to complete our first revision of the 2026 season data collection box within
                        the first few weeks of the school year. We have modified our code to output data in JSON formatting and only write data when new data is actually available, drastically
                        reducing file sizes. We've developed new wiring standards to improve the ruggedness of our system, and are looking forward to specing out a test car to allow for in-depth data collection.

                      DAQ has shifted to a new github repo during my team as lead which can be found <a href="https://github.com/Georgia-Tech-Off-Road/GTOR-DAQ">here</a>. Each
                        main project has it's own folder with any relevant documentation stored inside it. One notable example of this is the data visualization tool. Originally
                        built by me, this tool allows anyone on the team to download and process data files from test days and features the ability to update to the latest version
                        posted to github with the push of a button. Each screen features a button that opens documenation on how to use the tool, and an overarching .docx file provides
                        a deeper dive into the inner workings of the software. This documentation has allowed our Data Analysis and Software leads to take over development, freeing me up
                        to focus on the Hive Mind project.

                      Hive Mind represents my most ambitous DAQ project yet. I tasked our Electrical Engineering lead with desiging a new data collection PCB in early January
                        and the results are astounding. The board pictured on the right features dedicated SPI, I2C, and CAN ports with additional serial and UART connections
                        available on the right 16 pin connector. The board has a ADS158IRTCR ADC wired up to 16 single ended analog inputs, allowing for a staggering polling rate
                        of 23.7kSPS per channel at a monumental 24-bit resolution. There's a voltage regulator circuit to step our 7-11V Li-Po batteries down to the 5V required by
                        the Teensy 4.1 and a coin cell battery hookup to provide continous power to the Teensy's RTC. The plan is to stack anywhere from two to four of these boards
                        in custom 3D printed mounts on the front and back of the car to form a distributed computing network of microcontrollers. Each microcontroller will be able to
                        communicate with one another over SPI, sharing data and providing redundancy by doubling up on critical use cases. This will represent an absolutelty massive performance
                        increase compared with any preceeding DAQ team, pushing our data collection setup to the fore-front of BAJA SAE.
