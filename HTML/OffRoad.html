                       I joined Georgia Tech's off-road team partway through my first semester of college after
                       being introduced to it by a friend. I quickly found a home amongst the electrical and computer
                       engineering oreinted Data Aquisition team (DAQ), and will be serving as the next DAQ team lead starting
                       next year. I still have much to learn about how both the car and our tech works, but I'm excited for 
                       what my future with the team will look like.

                        During my time at DAQ I have personally worked on improving our radio range through the installation
                        of a larger antenna, helped with the addition of Hall-effect sensors on the front wheels, researched the use of a mesh network to improve
                        the range of our data transmission set up, started developing a data distribution server to facilitate easier access to live
                        data, built the battlestation (our data collection computer), and contributed in some way or another to almost
                        everything the team has worked on over this last semester. I'm excited to take over as team lead next year,
                        and plan on improving DAQ's documentation procedures and finishing the development and deployment of the projects listed above.

                      The Data Aquisition team exists to generate and feed data to all of the other teams in Off Road.
                      This is accomplished by connecting a multide of different types of sensors to the car and transmiting
                      their data back to what we've loving come to call the "Battlestation." The AUX DAQ (a small circuit board
                      mounted on the car to handle data collection and transmission) makes all of this possible through the use of
                      a custom transmission protocol designed by previous DAQ members. All of this tech is designed to take a bruising,
                      contending with everything from high velocity impacts to mud splashes for hours on end during races.
