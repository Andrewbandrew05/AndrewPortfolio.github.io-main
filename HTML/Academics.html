                       I attended Midtown International School from 7th to 12th grade. During this time I dual-enrolled at a variety of institutions, 
                        including Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, Georgia Tech, and Oglethorpe University. I complemented the college credits I earned 
                        from these institutions with AP tests, self-studying for a total of seven exams during my high-school years. I also played a prominent role in 
                        my school’s extracurricular community, joining a band, competing on several sports teams, and leading our robotics team through its first season. 
                        My hard work and determination led to me graduate as Valedictorian and become a Zell Miller Scholar.

                     I started college at Georgia Tech in the Fall of 2023. In the time since I first set foot on campus I've been inducted into the Alpha Tau Beta 
                        honor society, worked as a lifeguard at the Campus Recreational Center, joined and competed with the GT Men’s Novice Crew team, and become the 
                        head of GT Off-Road's Data Acquisition team. In the midst of my extra-curriculars I have maintained a 4.0 GPA, delicately maintaining a 
                        work-life balance amidst the much higher workload of college. I hope to complement my academic achievements with the experiential learning 
                        only a co-op and/or internship can provide, and look forward to hearing back from employers about my applications.
