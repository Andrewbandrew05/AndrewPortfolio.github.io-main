                       I attended Midtown International School, a tiny private school located in Atlanta Georgia, from 7th to 12th grade. During my time there, I dual-enrolled at a 
                       variety of institutions, including Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, Georgia Tech, and Oglethorpe University. I complemented the college credits I 
                       earned from my time at the later two with multiple AP tests, starting in Freshman year with AP US history and AP Biology. During this time I participated in
                       our high school robotics team, numerous sports teams, and a band, playing a prominent role in my schools extra-curricular community. My hard work and determination
                       paid off when I graduated as Valedictorian and became a Zell Miller Scholar.

                      I started college at Georgia Tech in the Fall of 2023. In the time since I first set foot on campus I've been inducted into Alpha Tau Beta, been trained
                      and hired as a lifeguard at the Campus Recreational Center, and become the future head of Off-Road's Data Aquisition team. I have simultaneously 
                      helped found an on-campus band and set up a modded minecraft server on my NAS, continuing to pursue my hobbies even as my workload dramatically increased.
                      I have yet to obtain an internship and/or co-op, but I am excited to hopefully dip my toes into the real-life workings of the tech-world sometime next summer.
