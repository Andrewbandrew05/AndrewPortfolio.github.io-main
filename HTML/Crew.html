                       I attended Midtown International School from 7th to 12th grade. During this time I dual-enrolled at a variety of institutions, 
                        including Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, Georgia Tech, and Oglethorpe University. I complemented the college credits I earned 
                        from these institutions with AP tests, self-studying for a total of seven exams during my high-school years. I also played a prominent role in 
                        my school’s extracurricular community, joining a band, competing on several sports teams, making it to nationals in the National History Day competition, 
                        and leading our robotics team through its first season. I even played on Lakeside High School's ultimate frisbee team, winning state at the JV level my 
                        junior year and competing at the varsity level during mysenior year. My hard work and determination led to me graduate as Valedictorian and become a Zell Miller Scholar.

                     I started college at Georgia Tech in the Fall of 2023. In the time since I first set foot on campus I've been inducted into the Alpha Tau Beta 
                        honor society, worked as a lifeguard at the Campus Recreational Center, joined and competed with the GT Men’s Novice Crew team, and become the 
                        head of GT Off-Road's Data Acquisition team. In the midst of my extra-curriculars I have maintained a 4.0 GPA, delicately maintaining a 
                        work-life balance amidst the much higher workload of college. I hope to complement my academic achievements with the experiential learning 
                        only a co-op and/or internship can provide, and look forward to hearing back from employers about my applications.
