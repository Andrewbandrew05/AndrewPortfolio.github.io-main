                      I set out to mount a pair of hall-effect sensors on the front wheels of OR-9 earlier this semester, one of which is working and the other of which needs 
                      a new connector. It was a group project in which I played a substantial role, and, while it's still technically not complete, I'm extremely optimistic about its future.

                        I first started experimenting with modifying code currently in use for hall-effects, learning how to properly set the paramters needed to make such a sensor work. This was done
                        with a small test board and my computer, and, before long, I was ready to put them on the car.

                        After Eric (the person designing the brake calipers) had finished his part of the project, I wired up the sensors with some help from Allen (another DAQ member).
                        I updated the AUX DAQ code to read from the new sensors, and everything seemed to be working perfectly. Unfortunately, though, I couldn't manage to get the AUX DAQ
                        to wirelessly transmit the data from the new sensors, leading me to call in help from more experience DAQ members.

                        After the dust had settled, I realized that the sensors weren't actually working as planned. A three hour long worksession ensued, during which my 
                        efforts were routinely frustrated by my inability to terminate female molex connectors. Luckily Visnav (the current DAQ lead) was able to crimp
                        on the proper connector, allowing the front left sensor to succesfully obtain data. I unfortunately sustained an injury during the work session, a picture
                        of which you can see on the left. The front right sensor still isn't working to my knowledge, but I hope to have it finished before the next testing day.
