                        I first attended Camp Friendenswald (the peaceful woods) when my dad was camp pastor. I think I was in 6th
                        grade at the time, and, even though I was much younger than my peers, I had an absolute blast.
                        Before long I was attending camp every summer, and, starting Junior year of Highschool, I decided to work
                        as a Summer counselor. Camp Friendesnwald is where I met my girlfriend, Amelia, where I found community and solace
                        after the depth of my best friend, and the focal point of my environmentally focused endeavours. I've learned
                        a lot from the peaceful woods and will always look forward to the next time I get to visit.

                        During 2022 my cabin had a Covid outbreak. I was quarantined after I developed symptoms, but in the couple
                        days before I had to hole up in my room I learned a little bit about how preschool teachers must have felt.
                        My poor campers had to wear masks in the 80F to 90F summer heat when no one else did, leading to much weeping
                        and gnashing of teeth. The outbreak necessitated the unfortunate cancelation of the next week of camp, but the lessons I
                        learned during the few short days before quarantine proved invaluable during the next year's camp.
