                       I first attended Camp Friedenswald (the peaceful woods) when my dad was camp pastor. I was in 6th grade at the time, and the experience gave me a 
                        new view on what it meant to be in touch with nature. Before long I was attending camp every summer, and began working as a Summer counselor as 
                        soon as I could. My time at camp helped me find community and solace after the death of my best friend, and the joy I brought to my camper’s faces 
                        during activities inspired me to come back year after year. I learned a lot from the peaceful woods and will always look forward to the next time I 
                        get to visit.

                        My cabin had a Covid outbreak during 2022. I was quarantined after I developed symptoms, but in the couple days before I had to hole up in my room 
                        I learned a lot about how stressful leadership positions could be. My campers had to wear masks in the 80F to 90F summer heat when no one else did, 
                        and it became increasingly difficult to keep them engaged as their frustration with the unfairness of the situation grew. I’m still disappointed my 
                        symptom development forced me to eventually leave them, but I managed to learn a lifetime of lessons in the time we had together.

                       I worked as a lifeguard during my last year as a camp counselor, diligently protecting the campers that I’d gotten to know over the last three summers.
                        I helped usher in the use of walkie-talkies to simplify communication between the lifeguards and our support staff, and could often be found cleaning 
                        trash out of the lake during my breaks. My co-workers and I luckily never had to execute a save, but I have the utmost confidence that we could, and
                        would, have successfully done so had the need arisen.
